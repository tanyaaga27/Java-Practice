Abstract Class : 
Using Abstract class we can achieve(0-100%) abstraction. By creating abstract class, we show only essential information and hide the internal details . The method body is defined in the class that extends it. 
 
-An abstract class can have abstract and concrete methods both. An abstract class have non-abstract methods but an abstract method cannot be inside a non-abstract class. 
abstact class vehicle{
int no_of_tyres;
abstract void start();
}
Class car extends vehicle{
 void start()
{
System.out.print(“Starts with key”);
}
}
Class scooter extends vehicle{
 void start()
{
System.out.print(“Starts with kick”);
}
}
-It is not possible to create an object of abstract class but reference can be made.
-If a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class has to implement all the abstract methods of abstract parent class.
