There are 4 types of Access Modifiers :- 
1) Private :- Private access modifiers are accessible only within the class.
  Fields and methods are declared as private can only be accessed within the class.
  If we declare a constructor as private, we cannot create an object of that class outside the class.

2) Default :- If you don't use any modifier, it is considered as default modifier. Default modifier is accessible only within the package.
3) Protected :- protected access modifier is accessible within package and outside the package(through inheritance).
                protected access modifier can be applied on fields, methods, and constructor. It can't be applied on the class.
                We have to declare the class as public to extend it to access protected members through inheritance.
4) Public :-  public access modifier is accessible everywhere.
